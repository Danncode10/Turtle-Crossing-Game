# Turtle Crossing Game

This is a simple Python game built using the `turtle` graphics module. The objective is to control a turtle that moves forward using the "Up" key, avoiding moving rectangles (cars) and progressing through levels.

This project is part of the course **100 Days of Python** by Angela Yu.

## Features
- Control the turtle using the "Up" key.
- Avoid moving rectangles (cars) that act as obstacles.
- Levels update after the turtle successfully reaches the top of the screen.
- Increasing difficulty with each level.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/turtle-graphics-game.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd turtle-graphics-game
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python game.py
   ```

## How to Play
1. Launch the game.
2. Use the "Up" key to move the turtle forward.
3. Avoid the moving rectangles (cars).
4. Reach the top of the screen to progress to the next level.
5. Each level increases in difficulty.

## Gameplay
- **Movement**: The turtle can only move forward using the "Up" key.
- **Obstacles**: Cars move horizontally across the screen. If the turtle collides with a car, the game is over.
- **Levels**: Successfully reaching the top of the screen advances the player to the next level.
